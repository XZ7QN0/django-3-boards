# Django-Boards (Django 3)
This is a repository for the Django Boards tutorial, written by Vitor Freitas, coded from scratch with Django 3.

The [tutorial](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html) 
is great at teaching just about every Django foundation under the sun. The problem with this tutorial, however, is that 
it was written for Django version 1.11.4 (September 4, 2017), and there have been large changes between Django 1 and 
Django 2. AFAIK, Django 2 and Django 3 don't have large differences in file structure.

## CREDITS
All credits for this code belongs to Vitor Freitas, for creating the tutorials. 
This repository exists merely as an updated code base for the tutorial (Django 3).
